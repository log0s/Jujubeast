    <!-- Third recipe: Babinka's Potato Salad -->
    <div id='bpSalad' class='recipe'>
        <h1>Babinka's Potato Salad</h1>
        <!-- List of ingredients -->
        <ul>
            <li>4 large potatoes (to be diced after boiling)</li>
            <li>4 hard-boiled eggs, diced</li>
            <li>3 heaping tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 heaping tablespoon mustard</li>
            <li>About 1/2 or more of a large pickle, diced</li>
            <li>About 1/2 cup or more, cooked peas</li>
            <li>Lawrey's (or other) seasoning salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Directions -->
        <p>Peel the potatoes, boil them for forty minutes or slightly more.  They should be barely firm enough to dice them (without mashing them).  Allow the potatoes to cool before trying to dice them.  When dicing, the chunks can be fairly coarse.

Dice the eggs and pickles.  These chunks should be smaller than the potato chunks, perhaps the size of large peas.

Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.  Adjust the mayo, mustard, and salt, to taste.</p>
